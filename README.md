# Azure HPC On-Demand Platform, your deployment to be HPC-Ready! 

Azure HPC On-Demand Platform (az-hop), provides the end-to-end deployment mechanism for a base HPC infrastructure on Azure. az-hop delivers a complete HPC cluster solution ready for users to run applications, which is easy to deploy and manage for HPC administrators. az-hop leverages the various Azure building blocks and can be used as-is, or easily customized and extended to meet any uncovered requirements. Industry-standard tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Packer are used to provision and configure this environment, which contains:
- An [HPC OnDemand Portal](https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation) for all user access, remote shell access, remote visualization access, job submission, file access and more,
- An Active Directory for user authentication and domain control,
- [Open PBS](https://openpbs.org/) or [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html) as a Job Scheduler,
- Dynamic resources provisioning and autoscaling is done by [Azure CycleCloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cyclecloud/?view=cyclecloud-8) pre-configured job queues and integrated health-checks to quickly avoid non-optimal nodes,
- A Jumpbox to provide admin access,
- A common shared file system for home directory and applications is delivered by [Azure Netapp Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/netapp/),
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboards to monitor your cluster,
- Remote Visualization with [noVNC](https://novnc.com/info.html) and GPU acceleration with [VirtualGL](https://www.virtualgl.org/).
