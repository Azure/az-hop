# Administrator Access

The `jumpbox` machine is used as an SSH bastion to access to Virtual Machines in the **azhop** environment. To do this a helper script `./bin/connect` is provided and generated by the build script. See the [Helper Scripts](helper_scripts) documentation for more details.

## SSHing Linux VMs

This can be done by running this command 
```bash
./bin/connect hpcadmin@<vm-name or private-ip-address>
```

## Accessing the CycleCloud portal
By default every users can access the CycleCloud portal as a readonly user. If you need admin access, then you have to create an ssh tunnel, but run it from the outside of the toolchain container as the container won't allow port redirection.

```bash
./bin/connect cyclecloud
```

Browse to the cycle UI https://localhost:9443/cyclecloud

Connect to Cycle with the **hpcadmin** user, read the secret stored in the key vault by running the **get_secret** helper command.
```bash
./bin/get_secret hpcadmin
```

### Accessing the AD VM
You need to create an ssh tunnel in order to access the AD VM, but run it from the outside of the toolchain container as the container won't allow port redirection.

```bash
./bin/connect ad
```

Now, with the tunnel, you are able to connect using RDP to the AD VM via `localhost` on port `3390`. Connect with the **hpcadmin** local account, for which you can retrieve the password from with the `get_secret` helper.
