# Jobs

## Active Jobs
Active jobs can be displayed thru the `Jobs / Active Jobs` menu. This for your own jobs or for all users jobs. Job details can be accessed by expanding the job. Only running and queued jobs are listed here, and job history can't be accessed.

## Job Composer
The `Jobs / Job Composer` menu allows you to :
- list your current jobs,
- view the status and details of your jobs,
- submit new jobs,
- create job templates.

> Note : Only jobs submitted from the job composer are listed because OnDemand keeps its own history inside the `$(home)/ondemand` directory.
