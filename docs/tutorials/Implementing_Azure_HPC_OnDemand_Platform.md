# Azure HPC OnDemand Platform lab guide
This lab will guide you on how to build and use an HPC cluster on Azure thru the whole deployment of an **azhop** environment.

## Requirements

- A Microsoft Azure subscription
- A work or school account with the Owner role in the Azure subscription
- A lab computer with:

  - Access to Azure
  - A web browser supported by the Azure portal (Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox)

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 15 minutes

To complete this lab, you must verify that your account has sufficient permissions to the Azure subscription that you intend to use to deploy all required Azure resources. The Azure subscription must have a sufficient number of available vCPUs.

### Task 1: Validate the owner role assignment in the Azure subscription

1. From the lab computer, start a web browser, navigate to [the Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com), and if needed, sign in with the credentials of the user account with the Owner role in the Azure subscription you will be using in this lab.
1. In the Azure portal, use the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box to search for **Subscriptions**, and in the list of results, select **Subscriptions**.
1. On the **Subscriptions** blade, select the name of the subscription you intend to use for this lab.
1. On the subscription blade, select **Access control (IAM)**.
1. On the **Check access** tab, select the **View my access** button, and in the listing of role assignments, verify that your user account has the `Owner` role assigned to it.

### Task 2: Validate a sufficient number of vCPU cores

1. In the Azure portal, on the subscription blade, in the **Settings** section of the resource menu, select **Usage + quota**.
1. On the **Usage + quotas** blade, in the **Search** filters drop-down boxes, select the Azure region you intend to use for this lab and the **Microsoft.Compute** provider entry.

   > Note: We recommend that you use the **South Central US**, **East US** or the **West Europe** regions because these currently are more likely to increase the possibility of successfully raising quota limits for the Azure virtual machine (VM) SKUs required for this lab.

1. Review the listing of existing quotas and determine whether you have sufficient capacity to accommodate a deployment of the following vCPUs:

   - Standard BS Family vCPUs: **12**
   - Standard DDv4 Family vCPUs: **64**
   - Standard DSv3 Family vCPUs: **16**
   - Standard DSv5 Family vCPUs: **48**
   - Standard HBrsv2 Family vCPUs: **480**
   - Standard NV Family vCPUs: **24**
   - Total Regional Spot vCPUs: **960**
   - Total Regional vCPUs: **830**

1. If the number of vCPUs isn't sufficient, on the subscription's **Usage + quotas** blade, select **Request Increase**.
1. On the **Basic** tab of the **New support request** blade, specify the following, and then select **Next: Solutions >**:

   - Summary: **Insufficient compute quotas**
   - Issue type: **Service and subscription limits (quotas)**
   - Subscription: Enter the name of the Azure subscription you will be using in this lab.
   - Quota type: **Compute-VM (cores-vCPUs) subscription limit increases**
   - Support plan: Enter the name of the support plan associated with the target subscription.

1. On the **Details** tab of the **New support request** blade, select the **Enter details** link.
1. On the **Quota details** tab of the **New support request** blade, specify the following settings, and then select **Save and continue**:

   - Deployment model: **Resource Manager**
   - Location: Enter the name of the target Azure region you intend to use in this lab.
   - Quotas: Enter the VM series and the new vCPU limit.

1. On the **Details** tab of the **New support request** blade, specify the following settings, and then select **Next: Review + create >**:

   - Advanced diagnostic information: **Yes**
   - Severity: **C - Minimal impact**
   - Preferred contact method: Choose your preferred option and provide your contact details.

1. On the **Review + create** tab of the **New support request** blade, select **Create**.

   > Note: Typically, requests for quota increases are completed within a few hours, but its possible that the processing might take up to a few days.

## Exercise 1: Prepare for implementing the Azure HPC OnDemand Platform environment

Duration: 40 minutes

In this exercise, you will set up an Azure VM that you will use for deployment of the lab environment.

### Task 1: Provision an Azure VM running Linux

1. From the lab computer, start a web browser, navigate to [the Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com), and if needed, sign in with credentials of the account with the Owner role in the Azure subscription you will be using in this lab.
1. In the Azure portal, start a Bash session in **Cloud Shell**. The **Cloud Shell** icon is located on the ribbon, on the right of the search box.

   > Note: If prompted, in the **Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell** window, select **Bash (Linux)**, and in the **You have no storage mounted** window, select **Create storage**.

1. In the **Bash** session, in the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following command to select the Azure subscription in which you will provision the Azure resources in this lab. In the following command, replace the `<subscription_ID>` placeholder with the value of the **subscriptionID** property of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab:

   > Note: To list the subscription ID properties of all subscriptions associated with your account, run `az account list -otable --query '[].{subscriptionId: id, name: name, isDefault: isDefault}'`.

   ```bash
   az account set --subscription '<subscription_ID>'
   ```

1. Run the following commands to create an Azure resource group that will contain the Azure VM hosting the lab deployment tools. In the following commands, replace the `<Azure_region>` placeholder with the name of the Azure region you intend to use in this lab:

   > Note: You can use the `az account list-locations -o table` command to list the names of Azure regions available in your Azure subscription:

   ```bash
   LOCATION="<Azure_region>"
   RGNAME="azhop-cli-RG"
   az group create --location $LOCATION --name $RGNAME
   ```

1. Run the following commands to download the Azure Resource Manager template and the corresponding parameters file into the Cloud Shell home directory. You will use the template and file to provision the Azure VM that will host the lab deployment tools:

   ```bash
   rm ubuntu_azurecli_vm_template.json -f
   rm ubuntu_azurecli_vm_template.parameters.json -f

   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azure/az-hop/main/scripts/arm/ubuntu_azurecli_vm_template.json
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azure/az-hop/main/scripts/arm/ubuntu_azurecli_vm_template.parameters.json
   ```

1. Run the following command to provision the Azure VM that will host the lab deployment tools:

   ```bash
   az deployment group create \
   --resource-group $RGNAME \
   --template-file ubuntu_azurecli_vm_template.json \
   --parameters @ubuntu_azurecli_vm_template.parameters.json
   ```

   > Note: When prompted, enter an arbitrary password that will be assigned to the **azureadm** user, which you will use to sign in to the operating system of the Azure VM.

   The supplied password must be between 6-72 characters long and must satisfy at least 3 of password complexity requirements from the following:
   - Contains an uppercase character
   - Contains a lowercase character
   - Contains a numeric digit
   - Contains a special character
   - Control characters are not allowed

   > Note: Wait until the provisioning completes. This should take about 3 minutes.

### Task 2: Deploy Azure Bastion

> Note: Azure Bastion allows users to connect to Azure VMs without relying on public endpoints and helps provide protection against brute force exploits that target operating system level credentials.

1. Close the **Cloud Shell** pane.
1. In the Azure Portal, select **Resource groups**, select the resource group you have created with the name `RGNAME`
1. Click on the VM named **azhop-vm0**,
1. Expand the **Connect** menu and select **Bastion**
1. As no Bastion already exists you are proposed to create one, select **Create Azure Bastion using defaults**
   > Note: Wait for the deployment to complete before you proceed to the next exercise. The deployment might take about 5 minutes to complete.
1. Enter **azureadm** as the user name and the password you set during the Azure VM deployment in the first task of this exercise, and then select **Connect**. You may have to disable the popup blocker as it may block the connection window. 
### Task 3: Install the az-hop toolset

1. Within the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following command to update the package manager list of available packages and their versions:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

1. Run the following command to upgrade the versions of the local packages and confirm when prompted whether to proceed:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get upgrade -y
   ```

1. Run the following command to install Git and screen:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install git screen
   ```

1. Run the following commands to clone the **az-hop** repository:

   ```bash
   rm ~/az-hop -rf
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/az-hop.git -b v1.0.24
   ```

1. Run the following commands to install all the tools required to provision the **az-hop** environment:

   ```bash
   cd ~/az-hop/
   sudo ./toolset/scripts/install.sh
   ```

   > Note: Wait until the script completes running. This might take about 5 minutes.

### Task 4: Prepare the Azure subscription for deployment

1. Within the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following command to sign in to the Azure subscription you are using in this lab:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

1. Note the code displayed in the output of the command. Switch to your lab computer, open another tab in the browser window displaying the Azure portal, navigate to [the Microsoft Device Login page](https://microsoft.com/devicelogin), enter the code, and then select **Next**.
   > Note: You may use **select** and **right click** to copy selected text. Be careful that **ctrl+c** will interrupt the command

1. If prompted, sign in with the credentials of the user account with the Owner role in the Azure subscription you are using in this lab,  select **Continue**, and then close the newly opened browser tab.
1. In the browser window displaying the Azure portal, within the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following command to identify the Azure subscription you are connected to:

   ```bash
   az account show
   ```

1. If the Azure subscription you are connected to is different from the one you intend to use in this lab, run the following command to change the subscription to which you are currently connected. In the following command, replace the `<subscription_ID>` placeholder with the value of the subscriptionID parameter of the Azure subscription you intend to use in this lab:

   ```bash
   az account set --subscription '<subscription_ID>'
   ```

1. Run the following command to register the Azure NetApp Resource Provider:

   ```bash
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.NetApp --wait
   ```

1. Run the following command to verify that the Azure Resource Provider has been registered:

   ```bash
   az provider list --query "[?namespace=='Microsoft.NetApp']" --output table
   ```

   > Note: In the output of the command, verify that the value of **RegistrationState** is listed as **Registered**.

## Exercise 2: Implement Azure HPC OnDemand Platform infrastructure

Duration: 90 minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy the Azure HPC OnDemand Platform infrastructure.

### Task 1: Customize infrastructure components

You can define an az-hop environment by using a configuration file named **config.yml**, which needs to reside in the root of the repository. The simplest way to create the environment is to clone the template file **config.tpl.yml** and modify the content of the copied file. In this task, you will review its content and if needed, set the target Azure region for deploying the Azure HPC OnDemand Platform infrastructure.

1. For this lab, a simplied template is provided, but take some time to review the content of the configuration file content from the azhop [define the environment documentation page](https://azure.github.io/az-hop/deploy/define_environment.html)

1. On the lab computer, in the browser window displaying the Azure portal, within the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following commands to download and copy **config.tpl.yml** to **config.yml**:

   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azure/az-hop/main/tutorials/lab1/config.tpl.yml -O config.yml
   ```

1. Open the **config.yml** file using your preferred editor such as `nano` or `vi`:

   ```bash
   vi config.yml
   ```

1. Review the content of the **config.yml** file and note that it includes the following settings:

   - **location**: The name of the target Azure region.
   - **resource_group**: The name of the target resource group. You do have the option of using an existing resource group by setting **use_existing_rg** to **true**.
   - **anf**: Configuration properties of Azure NetApp Files resources.
   - **admin_user**: The name of the admin user account. Its random password is autogenerated and stored in the Azure Key vault provisioned as part of the deployment.
   - **network**: Configuration properties of the Azure virtual network into which the Azure resources hosting the infrastructure resources are deployed.
   - **jumpbox**, **ad**, **ondemand**, **grafana**, **scheduler**, **cyclecloud** and **lustre**: Configuration properties of Azure VMs hosting the infrastructure components.
   - **users**: User accounts auto provisioned as part of the deployment.
   - **queue_manager**: The name of the scheduler to be installed and configured, which is **openpbs** by default.
   - **authentication**: The authentication method, which is **basic** by default. But you have the option of using **OpenID Connect** instead.
   - **images**: The list of images that will be available for deployment of compute cluster nodes and their respective configuration.
   - **queues**: The list of node arrays of CycleCloud and their respective configuration.

1. Change the name of the target Azure region set in the **config.yml** file to the one you are using in this lab, save the change, and then close the file.

### Task 2: Deploy Azure HPC OnDemand Platform infrastructure

1. Within the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following command to generate a Terraform deployment plan that includes the listing of all resources to be provisioned:

   ```bash
   ./build.sh -a plan
   ```

1. Review the generated list of resources, and then run the following command to trigger the deployment of the Azure HPC OnDemand Platform infrastructure:

   ```bash
   ./build.sh -a apply
   ```

   > Note: Wait for the deployment to complete. This should take about 15 minutes. After the deployment completes, you should observe the message stating something similar to **Apply complete! Resources: 142 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.**


### Task 3: Build images

The az-hop solution provides pre-configured Packer configuration files that can be used to build custom images. The utility script **./packer/build_image.sh** performs the build process and stores the resulting images in the Shared Image Gallery included in the deployed infrastructure. Because building these images is a long process, we will use `screen` to build them in parallel.

1. On the lab computer, in the browser window displaying the Azure portal, within the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following commands to build a custom image based on the **azhop-centos79-v2-rdma-gpgpu.json** configuration file.

   > Note: The image creation process based on the **azhop-centos79-v2-rdma-gpgpu.json** configuration file relies on a **Standard_d8s_v3** SKU Azure VM.

   ```bash
   screen -S packer1
   cd packer/
   ./build_image.sh -i azhop-centos79-v2-rdma-gpgpu.json
   ```

   > Note: Disregard any warning messages.

   > Note: Wait for the process to complete. This might take about 20 minutes.

   Detach from the current screen with `<ctrl>a+d`

1. Within the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following command to build a custom image based on the **azhop-centos79-desktop3d.json** configuration file.

   > Note: The image creation process based on the **azhop-centos79-desktop3d.json** configuration file relies on a **Standard_NV12s_v3** SKU Azure VM, however this lab assume that you have quota only for **Standard_NV6**, you will have to update the **azhop-centos79-desktop3d.json** to use it as explained below.

   Using **vi** or **nano** open the **azhop-centos79-desktop3d.json**, update `vm_size` to **Standard_NV6** and delete the line containing **managed_image_storage_account_type**. The content should look like this
```json
   {
      "builders": [
         {
            "type": "azure-arm",
            "use_azure_cli_auth": "{{user `var_use_azure_cli_auth`}}",
            "image_publisher": "OpenLogic",
            "image_offer": "CentOS-HPC",
            "image_sku": "7_8",
            "image_version": "latest",
            "managed_image_resource_group_name": "{{user `var_resource_group`}}",
            "managed_image_name": "{{user `var_image`}}",
            "os_type": "Linux",
            "vm_size": "Standard_NV6",
            "ssh_pty": "true",
            "build_resource_group_name": "{{user `var_resource_group`}}",
            "private_virtual_network_with_public_ip": "{{user `var_private_virtual_network_with_public_ip`}}",
            "virtual_network_name": "{{user `var_virtual_network_name`}}",
            "virtual_network_subnet_name": "{{user `var_virtual_network_subnet_name`}}",
            "virtual_network_resource_group_name": "{{user `var_virtual_network_resource_group_name`}}",
            "cloud_environment_name": "{{user `var_cloud_env`}}",
            "ssh_bastion_host": "{{user `var_ssh_bastion_host`}}",
            "ssh_bastion_port": "{{user `var_ssh_bastion_port`}}",
            "ssh_bastion_username": "{{user `var_ssh_bastion_username`}}",
            "ssh_bastion_private_key_file": "{{user `var_ssh_bastion_private_key_file`}}"
        }
    ]
```
   ```bash
   screen -S packer2
   cd packer
   ./build_image.sh -i azhop-centos79-desktop3d.json
   ```

   > Note: Wait for the process to complete. This might take about 40 minutes.

   Detach from the current screen with `<ctrl>a+d`

1. Check the image build status by switching between `screen` sessions.

   - **\<ctrl> a+d** : to detach
   - **screen -ls** : to list sessions
   - **screen -r [name]**: to reattach to the session [name]

A typical output of a successful image build should end like this
```

### Task 4: Review deployment results

1. On the lab computer, in the browser window displaying the Azure portal, open another tab, navigate to the Azure portal, use the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box to search for **Azure compute galleries**, and in the list of results, select **Azure compute galleries**.
1. On the **Azure compute galleries** blade, select the entry whose name starts with the prefix **azhop** and then on the compute gallery blade, verify that the gallery includes two VM image definitions.
1. In the Azure portal, use the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box to search for **Azure virtual machines**, and in the list of results, select **Virtual machines**.
1. On the **Virtual machines** blade, review the listing of the provisioned virtual machines.

   > Note: If needed, filter the listing of the virtual machines by setting the resource group criterion to **azhop**.

1. Close the newly opened browser tab displaying the **Virtual machines** blade in the Azure portal.

### Task 5: Generate passwords for user and admin accounts

1. On the lab computer, in the browser window displaying the Azure portal, within the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following command to generate the password for the **clusteradmin** and **clusteruser** accounts defined in the **config.yml** configuration file:

   ```bash
   cd ~/az-hop/
   ./create_passwords.sh
   ```

1. Run the following command to display the newly generated password of the **clusteradmin** account:

   ```bash
   ./bin/get_secret clusteradmin
   ```

   > Note: Record the password. You will need it later in this lab.

   > Note: The **./bin/get_secret utility script** retrieves the password of the user you specify as its parameter from the Azure Key vault, which is part of the Azure HPC OnDemand Platform infrastructure you deployed in the previous exercise.

## Exercise 3: Install and configure Azure HPC OnDemand Platform software components

Duration: 40 minutes

In this exercise, you'll install and configure software components that form the Azure HPC OnDemand Platform solution.

> Note: You will perform this installation by using Ansible playbooks, which supports setup for individual components and an entire solution. In either case, its necessary to account for dependencies between components. The setup script **install.sh** in the root directory of the repository performs the installation in the intended order. The components include: **ad**, **linux**, **add_users**, **lustre**, **ccportal**, **cccluster** (this component requires that custom images are present in the compute gallery), **scheduler**, **ood**, **grafana**, **telegraf**, and **chrony**.

### Task 1: Install Azure HPC OnDemand Platform software components

1. On the lab computer, in the browser window displaying the Azure portal, within the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following command to invoke the installation of the Azure HPC OnDemand Platform software components:

   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

   > Note: Wait for the process to complete. This might take about 30 minutes.

   > Note: In case of a transient failure, you can rerun the install script can be rerun because most of the settings are idempotent. In addition, the script has a checkpointing mechanism that creates component-specific files with the **.ok** extension in the playbooks directory and checks for their presence during subsequent runs. If you want to reapply the configuration to an existing component, rerun the install script with one of component name listed above.

### Task 2: Review installation results

1. After the installation completes, on the lab computer, in the browser window displaying the Azure portal, within the SSH session to the Azure VM, run the following command to display the URL of the Azure HPC On-Demand Platform portal:

1. On the lab computer, in the browser window displaying the Code Server, in the **Terminal** pane, at the **[clusteradmin@hpc-1 ~]$** prompt, open the newly created copy of the **run_opm.sh** file in a text editor.
1. Make the following changes to the file, and close it after saving the changes:

   - Modify the input file path (`INPUT`) by replacing the entry `~/opm-data/norne` with `/lustre/$USER/opm-data/norne`).
   - Modify the compute node configuration by replacing the entry `select=1:ncpus=40:mpiprocs=40:slot_type=hc44rs` with `select=1:ncpus=120:mpiprocs=60:slot_type=hpc`.
   - Add the `which flow` line following the `spack load opm-simulators` line.

   > Note: Leave the number of nodes set to **1** to avoid the quota limit issues.

   > Note: The original **run_opm.sh** file has the following content:

### Task 3: Review the results of the OPM job by using ResInsight

1. On the lab computer, in the browser window, switch back to the **Azure HPC On-Demand Platform** portal, and then in the **Interactive Apps** section, select **Linux Desktop**.
1. On the **Linux Desktop** launching page, from the **Session target** drop-down list, ensure that **With GPU** entry is selected. In the **Maximum duration of your remote session** field, enter **2**,  and then select **Launch**.

   > Note: In case your subscription doesn't have a sufficient number of quotas for the **Standard_NV6** SKU, choose the **Without GPU** entry instead.

   > Note: This will begin compute node provisioning of the type you specified. This also creates a new job with its **Queued** status displaying on the same page.

1. Switch back to the **Linux Desktop** launching page, and then verify that the corresponding job's status has changed to **Running**.
1. Adjust **Compression** and **Image quality** according to your preferences, and then select **Launch Linux Desktop**.

   > Note: This will open another browser tab displaying the Linux Desktop session.

1. Within the Linux Desktop session, start **Terminal Emulator**.

1. In the **Terminal Emulator** window, at the **[clusteradmin@vis-1 ~]$** prompt, run the following command to launch ResInsight:

   ```bash
   vglrun ResInsight
   ```

   > Note: This will open the ResInsight application window.

   > Note: If you're using a non-GPU VM SKU, rather than running `vglrun ResInsight, you'll need to launch ResInsight directly. To do this, in the **Linux Desktop** session, select **Application Finder** (the magnifying glass icon at the bottom, center section of the page). In the search text box, enter **ResInsight**. From the list of search results, select **ResInsight**, and then select **Launch**.

1. In the ResInsight application window, select the **File** menu header. From the drop-down menu, select **Import**, in the sub-menu, select **Eclipse cases**, and then select **Import Eclipse cases**.
1. In the **Import Eclipse File** dialog box, select **Computer**.
1. Navigate to **/lustre/clusteradmin/opm-data/norne/out_parallel**, and then from the list of files in the target directory, select **NORNE_ATW2013.EGRID**.
1. Review the case in the ResInsight application window.
1. Change the **Navigation Mode** to `Ceetron` in the 3d Views by opening the **Edit/Preferences** menu.
   - Rotation can be maintaining with the right mouse button
1. In the button ribbon, play the simulation with the **>** button.

## Exercise 8: Build, run, and analyze OpenFOAM

In this exercise, you will build, run, and analyze CFD simulation using OpenFOAM.

Duration: 60 minutes

### Task 1: Build OpenFOAM

1. On the lab computer, in the browser window displaying the Code Server, in the **Terminal** pane, at the **[clusteradmin@hpc-1 ~]$**  prompt, run the following command to build OpenFOAM 8:

   ```bash
   . ~/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
   module use /usr/share/Modules/modulefiles
   spack install openfoam-org@8
   ```
   > Note: Wait for the build to complete. This might take about 30 minutes.
### Task 2: Running the motorbike tutorial on a single node

1. On the lab computer, in the browser window displaying the Code Server, in the **Terminal** pane, at the **[clusteradmin@hpc-1 ~]$**  prompt, run the following command to load OpenFOAM modules:
   ```bash
   spack load openfoam-org@8
   ```

1. Copy the motorbike tutorial into scratch space
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /lustre/$USER
   cd /lustre/$USER
   cp -r $WM_PROJECT_DIR/tutorials/incompressible/simpleFoam/motorBike .
   ```

1. Run the case
   ```bash
   cd motorBike
   ./Allrun
   ```

1. Review all log files `log.*` for any errors

### Task 3: Running the motorbike tutorial on multiple nodes

The following updates are needed:

- Add FOAM_MPIRUN_FLAGS to the mpirun command when using runParallel (needed for all version of OpenFOAM)
- Reconstruct the single partition after the solve

1. On the lab computer, in the browser window displaying the Code Server, in the **Terminal** pane, at the **[clusteradmin@hpc-1 ~]$**  prompt, run the following commands:

   ```bash
      cd /lustre/$USER/motorBike
      sed -i '/RunFunctions/a source <(declare -f runParallel | sed "s/mpirun/mpirun \\\$FOAM_MPIRUN_FLAGS/g")' Allrun
      sed -i 's#/bin/sh#/bin/bash#g' Allrun
      sed -i 's/# runApplication reconstructPar/runApplication reconstructPar/g' Allrun
   ```

1. Now, create a PBS submit script, **submit.sh** withe the following content.

When running on multiple nodes it is necessary to export all the OpenFOAM environment variables (unless you add loading the modules in `.bashrc`). This is done with the `FOAM_MPIRUN_FLAGS` that are added to the `runParallel` in the last step. The script will run for the number of cores specified to PBS (`select` x `mpiprocs`)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
. ~/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
module use /usr/share/Modules/modulefiles
spack load openfoam-org@8
ranks_per_numa=4
export FOAM_MPIRUN_FLAGS="-hostfile $PBS_NODEFILE $(env |grep 'WM_\|FOAM' | cut -d'=' -f1 | sed 's/^/-x /g' | tr '\n' ' ') -x MPI_BUFFER_SIZE --report-bindings --map-by ppr:${ranks_per_numa}:numa"
$PBS_O_WORKDIR/Allrun -cores $(wc -l <$PBS_NODEFILE)
```

1. Save that file under the `/lustre/$USER/motorBike` directory

1. Run the OpenFOAM job

```bash
rm log.*
qsub -l select=2:slot_type=hpc:ncpus=120:mpiprocs=120,place=scatter:excl submit.sh
```

1. Monitor the job and wait for the job to be finished

### Task 4: Visualize the motorbike tutorial result

1. On the lab computer, in the browser window, switch back to the **Azure HPC On-Demand Platform** portal, and then in the **Interactive Apps** section, select **Linux Desktop**.
1. On the **Linux Desktop** launching page, from the **Session target** drop-down list, ensure that **With GPU** entry is selected. In the **Maximum duration of your remote session** field, enter **2**,  and then select **Launch**.

   > Note: In case your subscription doesn't have a sufficient number of quotas for the **Standard_NV6** SKU, choose the **Without GPU** entry instead.

   > Note: This will begin compute node provisioning of the type you specified. This also creates a new job with its **Queued** status displaying on the same page.

1. Switch back to the **Linux Desktop** launching page, and then verify that the corresponding job's status has changed to **Running**.
1. Adjust **Compression** and **Image quality** according to your preferences, and then select **Launch Linux Desktop**.

   > Note: This will open another browser tab displaying the Linux Desktop session.

1. Within the Linux Desktop session, start **Terminal Emulator**.

1. Install the **Paraview** viewer

```bash
wget "https://www.paraview.org/paraview-downloads/download.php?submit=Download&version=v5.10&type=binary&os=Linux&downloadFile=ParaView-5.10.1-MPI-Linux-Python3.9-x86_64.tar.gz" -O ParaView-5.10.1-MPI-Linux-Python3.9-x86_64.tar.gz

tar xvf ParaView-5.10.1-MPI-Linux-Python3.9-x86_64.tar.gz

```

1. Create a case file and launch Paraview

```bash
touch /lustre/$USER/motorBike/case.foam
vglrun ./ParaView-5.10.1-MPI-Linux-Python3.9-x86_64/bin/paraview
```

1. Open the model

Within **Paraview** open the case `/lustre/$USER/motorBike/case.foam`

When the model is loaded, you can view the geometry like this:
- In the bottom left pane, in the "Mesh Regions" list, unselect "internalMesh" and select "group/motorBikeGroup".
- Click "Apply" above the list.
- You should now see the model geometry, and you can move/rotate/zoom using the mouse.

Next, you can visualize the simulation results.
- Click the "Play" button on the toolbar at the top of the window to advance to the end of the simulation.
- On the Active Variables Control toolbar you will find a drop down box where you can select variables. For example, select "p" for pressure.
