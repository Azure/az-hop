            Specify the ParaView Home Directory to be used when starting ParaView.
            ParaView binaries should be located under this root directory.
            
            The launch script uses the following path to locate the ParaView executables:
            `$PARAVIEW_HOME/$PARAVIEW_VERSION/(glx|egl|osmesa)/bin/${executable}`.
            
            `glx` is used for launching the ParaView Qt client.  
            `egl` and `osmesa` are used for launching the ParaView server based on whether GPU
            support is enabled or not respectively.
